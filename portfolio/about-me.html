        <h2>Hear from Caroline</h2>
        <p>I guess this is the part where I am supposed to answer the notorious “tell us about yourself” question, but frankly, I don’t like that question. Although open-ended, it pressures you to put yourself in a box. I mean, let’s be honest, you tailor your answer to the time and place (after doing your research, of course). I don’t want to put myself in a box—not in my response to this question nor my career.</p>

        <p>I find that a lot of things pique my interest. Whether it be career-driven interests or hobbies I take on, I like to dabble in an array of areas. Nevertheless, there is one common denominator: ambition.</p>

        <p>I’m currently a senior at the University of Missouri-Columbia studying Strategic Communication with a minor in Business. I get excited about brand strategy, marketing, and multimedia storytelling because they allow us to connect with diverse people in creative and innovative ways. Thanks to the renowned <span class="journ-school-link"><a href="https://journalism.missouri.edu/">J-School</a></span> and its very own Missouri Method, I am grateful to have the experience and skills to execute a worthwhile deliverable in the latter areas.</p>

        <p>With my passion for storytelling comes my enthusiasm for growth. A good story is one with ups and downs, one that is authentic. I see every peak and every valley as an opportunity to learn something, to improve myself, and to improve others. That said, in my spare time I like to document my journey. Some entries I even spice up and post on <span class="blog-link"><a href="https://therapportroom.wixsite.com/blog/">The Rapport Room,</a></span> a lifestyle blog my good friend and I recently created.</p>

        <p>I also love a good adventure (the best ones are spontaneous)! I studied and interned abroad in London for a semester, an experience I am ever so grateful for. It reignited my passion for travel and my enthusiasm for life in general if you will. I learned to appreciate the present moment, and the little things throughout my journey. In the grand scheme of things, that’s what matters most. We all know that saying, “Little things make big things happen.”</p>
